# Smart Contract for comunity knockout tournaments and betting on the winner

All contracts in this repository are open source and created for the comunity. Once the contracts are deployed the deployer has no more access to the contracts. 

Players can compete in a knockout tournaments to win the price pool and users can bet on the winner of these turnaments. 

Disclaimer: I tried my best to make it as bullet proof as possible, but I do not take any responsability if something breaks. Please use at your own risk. 

There are two smart contracts:
- Tournament -> [tournament readme](README_tournament.md)
- Betting -> [Betting readme](README_bet.md)


Feel free to create a nice Frontend for it ;-)
